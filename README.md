# Artiss.blog Configuration

This is a WordPress plugin, used on the site artiss.blog to add site-specific (but not theme-specific) additional features.

It's all GPL so feel free to borrow, fork, etc, any component of it. Don't expect coding nirvana - I've written this for just my own site and not for public consumption so comments, coding standards, etc, may not apply.

The issues log is here for any issues on my site, not just with this configuration.
